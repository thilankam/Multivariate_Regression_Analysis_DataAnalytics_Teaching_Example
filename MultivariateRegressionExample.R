mm # mm here is a R object. 
summary(mm)$coef # The output above shows the estimate of the regression beta coefficients (column Estimate) and 
# their significance levels (column Pr(>|t|).
# The intercept is 107494.898 and the coefficient of Immigrant variable is -6656.839.
# The estimated regression equation can be written as follow:
# Homeowners = 107494.898 + (-6656.839)*Immigrant 
# We can rewrite it as: 
# Homeowners = 107494.898 - 6656.839*Immigrant.

# Using this formula, for each new value in Immigrant, you can predict the value for Homeowners.
# As an example:
# For Immigrant value = 0, we will get: Homeowners = 107494.898 - 6656.839*0 = 107494.898
# for Immigrant value = 20, we will get: Homeowners = 107494.898 - 6656.839*20 = -25641.88
# Predictions can be easily made using the R function predict().
# In the following example, we predict Homeowners for two Immigrant values: 0 and 20.
# you can pass the 0 and 20 values as a concatenated list for Immigrants as follows:
newImmigrantdata <- data.frame(Immigrant = c(0,  20))
mm %>% predict(newImmigrantdata)
